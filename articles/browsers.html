	<p class="intro">
		Well I’m not an expert, but after the talk we got this afternoon I’m not sure if I want to stay worI’m writing this post after a talk of mmmmmmm about weird browers. And with weird browsers he means WEIRD browsers. A few examples are: Xbox One, PlayStation Vita, Kiddle and other Smart TV’s E Readers and so on.
	</p>	
	<p>
		This browsers are a real hustle because browsers are not the main priority on a game console. And that does’nt sounds unlogical right? But as a old colleague once sayed to me
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		“If it isn’t perfect, I’ts shit”  —  Frank van Enter
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		And well, this was when I was working in a Michellin star restaurant where the stakes are really high and food was the main subject of the business. But if you, as a company and as team, want to deliver the best game console, why put a browser on it with is no good? The Xbox scored best in the tests, that is Microsoft for god sake!
	</p>
	<p>
		Assuming you are a developer, I hope you’ve heard about Progressive Enhancement. If not, please read this article by mmmm. If you do, I assume you are positive about it, because to quote the one:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		“The web is for everyone”  —  Tim Burners Lee
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		And we have the power to make that happen. Because in my eyes, a site doesn’t need to display on every browser exactly like you want it to. It needs to be usable on every browser, not just pritty. But there’s one big problem with this theory: JavaScript. And in perticular, JavaScript frameworks. And here is why:
	</p>
	<p>
		If you use a JavaScript framework like Angular, mmmmmmmm enz you are working the wrong way around. You begin with an awesome technology which is quite new, but you will need to create fallback settings for browsers who don’t use JavaScipt. Or for situations JS isn’t available (For more info about that please read mmmm by mmmm).
	</p>
	<p>
		So this i likes creating a electronic system to get you to the next floor and after you are done, your team has a brainstorm session about how you can provide a solution in case of an power failure. Not the other way around.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then what? Never use a JS framework again? That’s putting years of work in the bin. I don’t think everyone is going to be happy with that. The answer may lie in the motivation of an framework. The WHY you could call it.
	</p>
	<p>
		So why are we using a framework: because you as a developer (team) are writing awesome code, which is maintainable, reusable, clear and ‘easy’ to write. Awesome, but that’s also the problem, because you’re not going to use that application, the user is! And besides loading time, they don’t care about your awesome code. They care about the usability, even if they’re up in the mountains with a shitty 2g network.
	</p>
	<p>
		So if we want to make the belief of the creator of the web come true, we, as developers, need to reconsider the usage of JS frameworks and start to focus on the usability again. And that is done by Progressive Enhancement.
