	<p class="intro">
		In the first week of our minor Drububu came to show us his Pixelart. A timeconsuming work with he called “Fun”. Well i’m not shure about his opinion but I have to say, his work is Epic!
	</p>
	<p class="note">
		Note: If you want to see what i’m talking about, look at his webpage: http://drububu.com/
	</p>
	<p>
		So what is Pixelart. Like he tells it: “it’s like a puzzle”. His challange lies in finding the right pose, space enz. After he made his drawing, he converts it to pixels.
	</p>
	<p>
		A funny fact, after we asked in witch programs he made his art, his answer was MS Paint. We laughft, but he didn’t. He thought Paint is the best tool for the job. As he say’d: “I only need 4 of the 7 tools of Paint, so why use Illustrator of Photoshop!”
		And yeay, he’s actuarely right, right?
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		“Nobody wondered if Rembrandt painted with a touthbrush or a pencil”
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		So the base of his story was the pixelart. But becouse he’s a pragrammer, he went further than that. He made his pixels on a drawing ‘go home’. This is done by the followings steps:
		<ul>
			<li>Give every pixel-block his good location</li>
			<li>Drop the pixel-blocks at-random on the canvas</li>
			<li>Let the pixel-blocks move to thair ‘home location’ screen-pixel by screen-pixel </li>
			<li>Add a rule witch say’s: “Only one pixelblock can be in one pixel” so pixels need te move around each other</li>
			<li>After that add a rule then when a pixel needs to pass another pixel, this pixel needs to make space for the pixel. </li>
		</ul>
		Now all the pixels find thair way home.
	</p>
	<p>
		But after he made a bunch of this, he wanted more. So he decided to make a programm witch can convert 3D images to a 2D puzzle. An amazing Math-mathical program witch lead(led) to an even better application: The ‘Lego App’. The Lego App is an application witch transformes an image to that image in Lego’s. After that he writes a list from every type of lego’s needed in this structure. So: white ones, blue ones, red 1/3 ones enz. And afcouse, the amount of this pieces. All of this cost a costumer €200,- and as a treat he gets a digital 3D model which you can take apart by using a slider.
