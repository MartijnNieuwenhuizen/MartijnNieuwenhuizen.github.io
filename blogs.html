        <h1>PPK</h1>
        <p>
            Ramping on about Browsers, that’s the main thing this talk was about. He lost this fight but brought a good sign for me. My main thing here is that he made it seem like you had to use this API’s, and of course a lot of people do. But you don’t have to right! So, just don’t use them and if you use them, use them wisely.

            The lost of data or demolition of data. This is something I’ve never had to deal with. And yes, it’s one of the beauty's of the web that data shouldn’t get lost, but that’s what personal backups are for right!
            The way he lost is data is a completely different discussion. The discussion of the Multinationals (in this case: FUCKERS!).

            Luckely there is the “Save the data foundation”

        <p>
            Hacking your own coffee machine, AWSOME! It’s a challenge, in multiple ways. First, it’s a good idea. We try to implement IoT into our own company, but what to make!? It's really difficult to think of a useful implementation of IoT. But yeah, counting your cups of coffee isn’t that useful, Right?
            We are now enhancing the experience of deployment, you can expect a blog about this on the Occhio site or Medium.

            Now I know why you should use all those branches, and that works. After the talk I hade a little conversation with the presenter about small changes, changing the color of a button for example. It’s a bit much to create one single branch for this color change, but please do it! Eventually, it creates a good overview of your whole product’s development. So create a branch, call it something like: buttonUIChanges and enhance your projects development.

            Also, what a cool wall was that!

            Gulp, Grunt, Broccoli? and way, way more, can help you to organize/speed up your development. For example, if you use SASS, which I do, you can compile this with Gulp and let the browser refresh on any changes. That’s good right! But pay attention here!, think about what this tool does for you. So how is the compiled CSS? It could be very bad, so you could fuck-up your entire process! So think, and check what every tool does for you, and if that works, you could safely use it!

        <h1>Grrr</h1>
        <p>
            @Grrr there’s a ‘Front-end Designer’. So is this just a new term? or is it something with a good potential? Well, I think it’s just a new term. It basically means: a developer with an eye for design And @CMD, we are trained to think about this. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don’t, please do. Your work will get much more exciting because a good front-end needs a good design to be a good website!

        <h1>ING - API</h1>
        <p>
            How do you set up an API? and for who are u creating this API? Well, the ING creates it with the user in mind. This is good because you can think about what the user will do next, and get exactly that! That’s good. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, we didn’t see the actual API which means I'm not entirely sure that it works, but I think the setup is great!

        <h1>Thijs van der Vossen</h1>
        <p>
            Starting up is difficult, making it, even more! Thijs did this, but what means “Making it”? I think it means you created something that you get excited about when you tell someone about it. So if you want to have a company with 300 employees, do it. Start and invest entry on growth.         
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally, I don’t want 300 employees. This will mean I don’t develop/design anything anymore. My personal wish: Have a company who make a great product for people who encourage a better world. And with a really happy staff!

        <h1>IBM</h1>
        <p>
            BIG, CORPORATE, BORING, OLD SCHOOL and so on are the terms you think of if you walk into an IBM office. But, not everything inside IBM is like this! Vincent works for names he couldn’t mention at products he couldn’t mention but ensures us that it’s innovating. And IBM Bluemix is an example of this! They allow you to use a lot of IBM products for a relative a small amount of money. And I hope that that is the new way IBM is going to. They are here for a long time, and managed to cope with the rest of the agile, flexible start-ups, so Keep Up!!!
